136.5 MW Wind Power Projects in Brazil by Babilônia

The project 136.5 MW Wind Power Projects in Brazil by Babilônia consists of five (5) project
activities installed in Brazil, located in the state of Bahia, at the Village Ourolândia. The promoter
of the project is Babilônia Holding S.A., a company which has the full ownership of the project
activity.

The details of the registered project are as follows:

The purpose of the project activity is to generate electricity by harnessing the wind energy by the
installation of Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs). The proposed project activity consists of five (5)
project activities installed at the same location, clustered in a wind farm complex of total capacity
136.5 MW.
___________
It is expected that the project activity replaces anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases
(GHGs) at approximately 294,885.4 tCO2e per year, displacing an estimated average of
637,728 MWh/year from the generation-mix of power plants connected to the Brazilian grid.
Project activity will mitigate the total GHG emission reductions of 589,440 tCO2 e over the
entire crediting period, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation efforts
